        <p>In her Starting Out In Tech series, WorkingNation Associate Producer & Project Manager Jaimie Stevens shares her
            insight on what it takes to succeed in learning computer programming skills.
            WorkingNation’s Jaimie Stevens. There are a lot of blogs about tech — so many, in fact, that I’ve decided to
            break the blog recommendations down into increments. This article, in particular, is meant to help you shape
            your coding ability. What can you read that’s specifically meant to improve your coding skills as a beginner?
            Here are a couple of my favorites for you, for a variety of languages.
            CodePen Blog This is the first blog I used in my very first introduction to coding class with General Assembly.
            CodePen is an online community for testing and showcasing user-created HTML, CSS and JavaScript code snippets.
            It works by letting you create “pens,” which are sets of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as an online code
            editor and an open-source learning environment. CodePen is one of the largest communities for web designers to
            show their coding skills.
            NSHipster The blog brings a sense of humor and personality to learning more about Objective-C, Swift, and Cocoa.
            They have a strong team of writers and have a couple of publications out if you like what you see online. They
            also put together their own “NSHipster quizzes” so you can challenge yourself if you want to.
            Ray Wenderlich This blog is a great place to improve your skills in iOS, MacOS, Unity, Swift, and Apple Game
            Frameworks. The blog has podcasts, as well as an extensive video tutorial collection for each of the
            aforementioned languages. A large team of authors, editors, subject matter experts, app reviewers, etc. power
            the site and their priority is to make it the most challenging topics easy for everyone to learn. The Ray
            Wenderlich blog has a massive library of coding tutorials.
            CSS-Tricks When it was founded back in 2007, CSS-Tricks was primarily all about CSS. Since then, the blog has
            become all about web design and development. It provides you with video screencasts about HTML, Flexbox,
            building games with JavaScript and more. It contains a section with complete guides ranging from table elements
            to jQuery to CSS Gradients, as well as an almanac that lists CSS selectors and properties. There is also a forum
            for comments and questions and a page for job postings as well. RELATED STORY: Side projects that will enhance
            your programming skills
            The Crazy Programmer This blog provides informative articles about programming and the tech scene in addition to
            programs, tutorials, and practice interview questions about C, C++, Java, Android, Python, .Net, PHP,
            Javascript, SQL and PL/SQL. It also gives recommendations on free eBooks to read for all of those languages.
            The Daily WTF I mentioned in one of my other articles that, even though it might seem like you are working
            independently as a coder, you need to be prepared to work with a team. You don’t want to be the weak team
            member. The Daily WTF is a user-submitted blog that highlights some of the worst coding practices that happen in
            a real working environment. While you’re working on your own as a beginner, this blog can give you a glimpse of
            what it’s like to work with bad coders, and teach you what not to do. Plus it’s funny. The Daily WTF blog has a
            humorous bent on web programming and IT culture.
            My Programming Blog (MPB) This blog provides articles on programming tricks, tools, and shortcuts. It has
            tutorials on C, Java, PHP, Python, and Ruby on Rails. The blog, created in 2011, is designed to help people
            navigate the world of programming and development tools. The creator of the blog started the site with some
            basic notes and questions that he gathered in class in college. Apparently, the posts came in high demand by the
            community, and soon his personal blog turned into the programming review, snippets, and tutorials provider that
            it is today.</p>
